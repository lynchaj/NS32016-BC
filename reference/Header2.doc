There has been much discussion about simple 32k systems.  I actually
built one and here it is.  I originally ran TDS on it.  I am now well
along porting Minix to it.  I wrote an assembler, linker, and library
archiver which run on generic C machines (UNIX, PC-DOS, etc.).  I
could post them if there is interest.  I also made small modifications
to GCC to make it compatible with my assembler.
