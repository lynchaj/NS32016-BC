I wire-wrapped my board.  It is only about 50 IC's, so it did not take too
long (still, plenty tedious).  I am glad that I have the flexibility of a
wrapped board.  I had an excellent board to use.  It is four layers,
with good low impedance power and ground planes inside.  This may be
important at 10MHz.
